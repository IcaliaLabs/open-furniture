          As software designers, we saw the opportunity to take this for making tangibly elements. So from the starting point that we wanted to renovate our office interiors, we designed a series of furniture that can only be made by using technology. This means that our process of designing technology for others comes now that we are using technology in order to produce our very own furniture. This not only gives us more identity of who we are and how we like to work, but this also give us the opportunity to share it to the world. We are making all our furniture open source for those who like us, are passionate about working in great environments.
